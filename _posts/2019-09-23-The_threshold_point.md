#### What is wrong right now?

It's actually really simple! not every citizen understand economy not everyone feels he is a part of it and no one now a days totally engages themselves with government system.
We ask for "Equality' and yet we ignore the fact that nature doesn't believe in it, we ask for "Humanity" and yet we support the nationalism.
We preach for "Love & Peace" by investing majorly in Defence and Weapon.

If you are a keen reader you might have understood, that I am pointing at hypocrisy's in our system.

Now, I for one am an intellectual human, ptrioatic individual and a proud citizen but truth be told I am utterly unhappy by the current scenario of our country.
"The part of the problem is the solution", we try so hard as a country to prove that we are doing good, in order to do so we start ignoring the fact that we still have lots of problems and we still have lot to figure out.
Our ignorance and our sheer belief in false patriotism have led us to a path where its plainy dark and gloomy to find the road ahead

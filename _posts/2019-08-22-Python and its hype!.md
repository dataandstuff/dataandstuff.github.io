> The problem is not with the language but with the false belief it triggers in common people that is "Its Easy to learn python".

## Love and support

You can't deny the fact that python recieves the most highest order of love and support form its community and its soley because its being sold to each and every one as the most hottest chick of the town and also this chick is really good and on top of that this chick is really easy to make friends with, which by fact never happens with nerds and software engineers

##Popularity

By far one of the most widely adopted language is python it has a soft corner from each and every developer just beacuse its cute, elegant and it does'nt shows off rather it try to impress you by all her tricks(dynamic typing) and blush(pip)

##The word "Easy"

Almost every one who started to learn this language has come across people who claim that python is "easy" to undertand and also "easy" to implement, which turns out to be soo true at beginning but the moment you start solving some real world problems you will realise how nonsense was the idea of "easy".

##Learning Curve

Its true that python has almost 3 days of learning curve for experienced programmer and 14 days for intermediate programmer and 30 days for beginners but the problem is that truly the learning curve never ends; the moment you understand one concept in python is the moment 10 new concept of same origin are being pushed to python standard library.
It makes it really hard for you to be in syns with the latest trend, its just like a new trend in fashion is on the rocks in paris, but you my friend, you live in antractica its highly impossible that you would ever come to know of it, even if you do it won't make much sense to most of the people out there at antarctica.

##Difference between Programmer|Coder|Datascientist
These are the only people who have made this language so popular hyped and whatever it is today, for every one has their own context of using it.

Programmer believe that its a great language for interfacing, security, sandwiching etc..

Coders believe that its a great tool to practise Datastructure & Algorithm, hence solve any problem with ease.

Datascientist, these people only use this language as a software tool, no standards nothing just a tool like MS excel.

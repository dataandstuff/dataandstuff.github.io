There are lots of powerful things you can do with the data. Some of the best things can be seen when you look at your day to day activity.

Data created by humans is like a carbon footprint but with lots of other details as well, we get soo much information per minute that it takes billions of dollars to make a system which is efficient enough to handle such data!


## Data and its sources

We all think that huge amount of data must come via social media but that is not true, some of the largest volume of data comes from the place where no one is looking at:

+ ~~Social Media~~ < Darknet
+ ~~Bank~~ < Government
+ ~~Space Exploration~~ < Satellite


## Why do we collect data?

There are two reason to do so first is simple other is `complex`.
but to understand the difference you should definately learn more about the 'flow of data' first

## Which language we use to study data?

You will always come across two names and we will also use these two they are :

#### R

```R
print("Hello World!", quote = FALSE)
```

#### Python

```python
print("Hello World")
```
